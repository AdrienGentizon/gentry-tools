## **TypeScript**'ed (loosly more probably) code snippets

Here I put things that I coded through challenges, pastime. It could also be things that I stumbled on when looking for some solution.

These code snippets can be more or less useful since their aim are not obvious at first glance.

I'll probably try to code some classic algorithmic problems on my learning path.

Feel free to use whatever feels right to you.

P.S.:
_Even if it does not look like, it could have take a lot of ðŸ§  to achieve some of those._
